## Architecture

> The battle against complexity in web development is a constant tug of war. We give a little to get something new, we take it back to make it simpler.
> Progress is good. Complexity is a bridge. Simplicity is the destination.

Funnily enough, this is a [quote from DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh/introducing-propshaft-ee60f4f6). For those unfamiliar, DHH is the founder of Ruby's Rails framework, and is a huge proponent of the "mighty monolith." While we disagree with his ideal architecture, we very much subscribe to keeping things simple. In a similar vein, knowing when to buy something vs build it ourselves is an important part of our jobs. There's no need to be continually reinventing the wheel.

Microservices for the win. Federated GraphQL to avoid Christmas tree? Kubernetes. Service mesh. Protobufs when talking svc-svc.

## Development Environment

Containerization changed everything. Long ago are the days of needing a version manager for every language you‚Äôre tinkering with, and trying to remember the syntax of each one. [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) solves part of the problem, but [docker FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) renders most version tooling obsolete. Pick a language and version (and even platform); now it‚Äôs not only checked into source code, but used in every environment.

But there‚Äôs so much more... the Dockerfile allows you to configure a ‚Äúbox‚Äù with as much or as little as you desire - and it‚Äôs reproducible! ü™¶ Chef and Ansible. You can easily look at a Dockerfile, and with a basic understanding of how a shell works, know what you can expect from the container it will spin up.

All that is to say that setting up your local environment is as easy as setting up [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)...

Compose files are included with tooling to run language/framework commands:

```sh
# pro-tip
alias dr='docker compose run --rm '

dr npm install left-pad
dr npm update

dr go get -d golang.org/x/net
dr go mod tidy

dr bundle exec rails specs
dr bundle exec rails g model thing
dr bundle exec rails db:setup
```

Spinning up a local server typically consists of:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
docker compose up -d
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

We don‚Äôt want to argue about style... there are linters provided for most languages that cover everything from syntax to formatting to deprecations to complexity. Make sure your editor is setup to use those linters, or get yelled at by the hooks before you can commit your changes.

## Continuous Integration

We‚Äôre avid believers of protecting ourselves from... ourselves. CI enables us to do things like:

- verify our tests are passing
- check our code against linters
- static code analysis
- build various artifacts
- keep our dependencies current

...all without you really having to know much about the repo. Just like the REPL you get into when you‚Äôre debugging code, CI let‚Äôs you know when things aren‚Äôt ready to be merged just yet, and most importantly, how to rectify things!

We make extensive use of GitHub Actions. Reusable workflows are kept in <https://github.com/dudo/dudo>, and templates for adding Actions to a new repo are available in <https://github.com/dudo/.github/workflow-templates>.

## Continuous Deployment

GitOps. Flux pull-based. Kubernetes.

## Provisioning Resources

GitOps. Terraform. Databases. K8s cluster. Auto scaling k8s.

## Observability

So... your PR was merged. Congratulations! An image was built, tagged, and pushed up to the container registry. Kubernetes has presumably detected the new tag, pulled the image, and started scaling up replica sets. Incoming requests are gradually diverted to the new pods. Your changes are taking traffic. Now what?

Go SLO to go fast. Microservices necessitate advanced observability. Distributed tracing.
