### Career

- I love the observability space. Logs, metrics, traces. Huge fan of distributed tracing, especially considering the state of microservice architecture. 
- I use Docker for all the things. K8s in production.

### Passions

- Big fan of Jeeps... 
- Spend a lot of time tinkering on all sorts of passion projects, which are in a constant state of upgrading.
