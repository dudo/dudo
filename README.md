### Career

- I love the observability space. Logs, metrics, traces. Huge fan of distributed tracing, especially considering the state of microservice architecture. 
- I use Docker for all the things. K8s in production.

### Passions

- Big fan of [Jeeps...](https://gist.github.com/dudo/5fb982228e88cf5826e7d54662788e16) 
- Spend a lot of time tinkering on all sorts of passion projects, which are in a constant state of upgrading.
